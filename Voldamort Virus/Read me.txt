--> This virus runs as a exe called "voldamort.exe" and this will encrpyt all your files (not folders) in the directory you run this on . so be careful
--> I have also given a fix to this called "voldamort_fix.exe" just run this file in the directory in which you have run the "voldamort.exe" file and you are good
    to go.
--> REMEMBER DONOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILES ["voldamort.exe","voldamort_fix.exe"] 
--> The password is "Teri Chain Chain"
--> Use only this to troll people and please DONOT put this on a c drive
